# Agent Playground

A personal learning playground focused on **AI agents**, **LLMs**, and modern agent-based systems.

This repository works as a **public learning log and portfolio**, where I track my progress while studying and experimenting with current tools and architectures in the agent ecosystem.

---

## Scope

This project covers topics such as:

- AI agents and agent workflows
- LangChain and related tooling
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Deep Agents
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Ongoing experiments and updates

Each topic or course is organized in its own folder, with a dedicated README explaining the context and learning goals.

## Notes

- This repository is continuously evolving.
- The code and notebooks are learning-oriented, not production-ready.
